I'm using signed permanent cookies to track users in my app, and sometimes it's
nice to be able to be able to set them in the browser manually. I'm using "Edit This Cookie"
in Chrome to handle this, but it was a bit tricky to figure out how to get the
encrypted value of the cookie to manually set it. Well, for future reference, I'll put it here.

    cookie_jar = ActionDispatch::Cookies::CookieJar.new(Rails.configuration.secret_token)
    cookie_jar.permanent.signed[:foo] = 'bar'
    cookie_jar[:foo] # => "BAhpBg==--8e5eb732858427af92a0c1eeb4f81b276a775fb8"
