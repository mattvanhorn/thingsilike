title: Getting Settled In San Francisco

I've been in San Francisco for about a month now, and I am finally starting to
feel like I am getting settled. I've mostly adjusted to the changes in my job, 
and I've got almost all the furniture I need, and I am back to training jiu 
jitsu, although not as frequently as I'd like.

I'm going to write a post giving my first impressions of the city, as compared 
to NYC, because that seems to be a required post for developers and/or startup
employees. But first, I am working on a story about stories.
