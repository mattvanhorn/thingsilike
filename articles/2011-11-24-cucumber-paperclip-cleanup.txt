title: Cleaning Up After Paperclip Cucumber Tests

I love using cucumber for acceptance testing, but recently on a personal project
I noticed that I was accumulating files in my public/system directory every time
a paperclip step was executed. A little googling got me to 
[a solution](http://blog.ardes.com/2009/8/4/that-cuking-paperclip), which I've 
adapted below for Rails 3.1

In features/support/env.rb:
    require 'paperclip'
    
    module Paperclip::Interpolations 
      alias_method :orig_attachment, :attachment 
      def attachment(att, style) 
        "cucumber/" + orig_attachment(att, style) 
      end 
    end
    
    After do 
      `rm -rf #{"#{Rails.root}/public/system/cucumber"}`  #remove paperclip files
    end
